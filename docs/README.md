# Documentation

This folder contains “wiki-style” documentation that is safe to vendor with the source tree. If you prefer GitHub Wiki pages, you can copy these files into the repository wiki.

- `Configuration.md`: controller flags and ConfigMap usage
- `Helm-Chart.md`: Helm install/upgrade notes and common values
- `Gateway-API.md`: enabling and current limitations
